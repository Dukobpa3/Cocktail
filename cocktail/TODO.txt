== TODO ==

High level TODO list for the project, there are also TODO in the code for smaller tasks.
This is not an exhaustive list, only used as a remainder


== CSS 2.1 == 

=== missing styles

==== IMPORTANT

- list styles (list-style, list-style-image...)
- tables styles, table layout

==== LESS IMPORTANT

- content (with :after and :before pseudo-styles)
- direction, unicode-bidi (useful for right to left languages)
- clip
- counter
- paged media styles

=== incomplete styles

- display, misses list and tables related values
- border/outline, only support for solid lines
- outline, no support for "invert" value (inverted color)
- overflow, no implementation of the "scroll" value

=== buggy implementations

- margin collapsing has some bugs
- "clear" style implementation should be improved
- background-attachment implemented as CSS style but not implemented at rendering
- vertical-align, other than baseline, not tested enough
- white-space, not tested enough
- float, regression, don't work properly when applied to inline level element

== CSS 3 ==

=== missing styles (not all CSS 3 styles here, only those that we plan to implement in the year)

- border-radius
- box-shadow / text-shadow
- gradient

=== nice to have

- media queries
- font-face

=== buggy implementations

- CSS transition, only style with 1 float value works now (like width, height...), no color or matrix transitions for instance.
- CSS transform (2d), mostly implemented but currently broken.
- for background styles, support for list of values (for instance to have multiple background-image) mostly implemented but currently broken.

== HTML 4 == 

=== features

- implement the "onload" event and generally improve startup
- managing html entities

=== missing tags

- textarea
- select
- button
- embed

=== nice to have

- plugin system for object and embed tag
- true html parser (instead of haxe xml parser)
- iframe

== HTML 5 ==

=== nice to have

- canvas 2d
