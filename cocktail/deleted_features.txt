== Deleted Features ==

This doc keep track of removed code, which might have been removed
because it was buggy, hard to maintain or out of scope for cocktail


Advanced hit Testing == 4278fbc979da2b1b1fc8df4c9fb2dd49cfd16b26
Was used in flash to draw the hit testing sprite around flash native 
object such as swf, so that their mouse and touch event could be catched.
Removed as was specific to flash but included implementation in core package
and can be re-implemented using the embedding api, by using the onUpdate
callback of the document
