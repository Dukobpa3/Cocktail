Cocktail, an HTML/CSS rendering engine for the [Haxe](http://haxe.org/) language 
=============

* Cocktail is implementing the [W3C](http://www.w3.org/) HTML and CSS standards in Haxe.

* With Cocktail, write HTML/CSS applications in Haxe and build them for [NME](http://www.nme.io/) and flash/Air. As Cocktail uses the standard DOM API, you can also build your app to regular JavaScript.

* Use it by embedding it inside your app/game, like a webview, and create your UI in HTML/CSS.
