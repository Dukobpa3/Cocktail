#Cocktail SWC

This tool builds a [SWC file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_SWC_file) containing the cocktail's code base.
With this SWC, you can use cocktail from a pure ActionScript 3 project.

##Build

To build the SWC, you need Haxe 3. To build, run : 
 > haxe build.hxml
 
This creates the SWC in the bin folder
